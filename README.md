# DIGITAL SPECIES

A native desktop organism that lives on your screen overlay. This digital lifeform exhibits symbiotic behavior with the machine, reacting to CPU cycles and system energy.

- Symbiotic: Thrives on idle CPU cycles.
- Transparent: Frameless window, always on top.
- Reactive: Monitors system performance in real-time.
- Background: Minimized to System Tray functionality.
